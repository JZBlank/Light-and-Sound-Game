SITE Pre-Work Submission
Name: Joyce Zhang

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used the codepath Prework website and w3schools.com to make the game engaging. The art is drawn by me.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
One challenge that I encountered in creating this submission was writing code for the game logic portion of the assignment. Since I did not fully understand 
the abilities of the variables that were listed, I had some trouble coding the if and else statements. For example, the guessCounter and the progress 
confused me because I thought they both fulfilled the same requirements and that there was no need for two of the same type of variable. However,
after reading through the assignment again, I then understood that what both variables are used for. While the guessCounter and progress are 
both similar in the fact that they keep track of something, the progress is used to keep track of where you are in the pattern while the guessCounter keeps track of 
how many guesses you have made. Both variables can then be used to make if and else statements to create conditions and ask the program whether or not these conditions were met. 
After taking a look at the solution given, I understood how the variables were used and just how the if and else statements worked. I usually tend to write a lot of code 
that is not necessary because it is the only way I understand it however, after taking a look at the solution, I was able to understand what I was coding and why it worked.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
One thing that I always have on my mind when I think about web development is the fact that there is never a stopping point when developing a web page. Often times, companies with websites
will want to have their websites updated every time a new product or event is happening. What is the process like for updating and adding on to these websites? From my understanding, there
are number amount of people who first sketch out their ideas on how the website will look like, and then web developers (front end and back end) will code and upload the necessary
changes to make the website better looking and updated. How long does this process usually take? How much time are web developers given? This was one thing that I was thinking when completing this
project.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would definitely take a look at making the game look more professional. If this were a project for a company and this company was going to sell this game, then 
the quality of it should be high as to not underwhelm the public. So definitely, the looks of the project, and making sure everything is running smoothly will be important. If I had more time, I would also
make Start button the center of attention, with added effects, to make the game dramatic and engaging. Adding features like a background that fits the theme of this game will also probably help with the
game aesthetic.
